# Prolog-Implementation-of-Hitting-Set-Algorithm-for-Diagnosis-in-Fault-Detection-Systems



This Prolog project implements the Hitting Set Algorithm for fault diagnosis in fault detection systems. The Hitting Set Algorithm is a well-known technique for determining the minimal set of test cases required to identify faults in a system. 

The project consists of four main parts: 

1. The Hitting Tree Part: This section creates a tree structure representing all possible fault scenarios in the system. Each node in the tree represents a possible set of faults, and each edge represents a fault diagnosis test. The goal of this section is to build the tree by recursively constructing its nodes, ultimately resulting in a complete tree representing all possible fault scenarios. 

2. The Gather Diagnoses Part: This section gathers all possible fault scenarios from the tree created in the previous section. It recursively traverses the tree, starting from the root node, and collects all possible fault scenarios. 

3. The Get Minimal Diagnoses Part: This section takes the fault scenarios gathered from the previous section and determines the minimal set of fault scenarios required to identify all faults in the system. 

4. The Hitting Set Algorithm: This section brings all the previous sections together to implement the Hitting Set Algorithm. It first builds the Hitting Tree, then gathers all possible fault scenarios, and finally determines the minimal set of fault scenarios required to identify all faults in the system. 

Overall, this Prolog project provides a robust and efficient way to diagnose faults in fault detection systems. By using the Hitting Set Algorithm, it is possible to identify the minimum set of test cases required to diagnose faults accurately, ultimately reducing the overall cost and complexity of the diagnosis process.
